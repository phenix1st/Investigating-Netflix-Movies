# Investigating Netflix Movies  

This project is part of the **DataCamp Data Scientist track**, where I explored and analyzed a dataset of Netflix movies to uncover insights about movie durations, release years, and genres.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to practice **data analysis with Python** by:  
- Cleaning and exploring a dataset of Netflix movies.  
- Visualizing trends in movie durations over time.  
- Identifying popular genres and specific movie patterns.  
- Applying filtering, grouping, and aggregation techniques.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.  
2. Analyzed basic statistics (release years, durations, genres).  
3. Filtered movies (e.g., Action movies under 90 minutes from 1990).  
4. Found the most frequent durations using `.mode()`.  
5. Visualized duration trends using histograms and plots.  

## 📈 Insights Gained  
- Most Netflix movies tend to cluster around a specific duration.  
- Short movies (<90 mins) are relatively common.  
- Certain genres dominate in specific time periods.  

## 🚀 How to Run
